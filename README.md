# Finding-routes-between-specified-nodes-in-graph-data-structure
A rectangular city area, surrounded by 4 different cities on each of its border, has a grid system where altitude of different nodes are stored using graph data structures. The goal is to perform BFS or DFS to find the route between 2 nodes and the route between 2 cities. Here we are using 2D matrix list to store the data in graph.
- [ ] a. The config_system method is to read data from configuration file and capture rows & columns of star city by assuming the file uses a specific format with data separated by commas and rows separated by newlines.
- [ ] b. Method to retrieve the neighboring nodes of a specific node within the "star city" data structure
- [ ] c. A method to implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find a route from a source node to a destination node within the "star city" data structure
- [ ] d. A method to implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a route from Blue Valley (source city) to Smallville (destination city) within the provided matrix
