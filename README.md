# Finding-routes-between-specified-nodes-in-graph-data-structure
A rectangular city area, surrounded by 4 different cities on each of its border, has a grid system where altitude of different nodes are stored using graph data structures. The goal is to perform BFS or DFS to find the route between 2 nodes and the route between 2 cities. Here we are using 2D matrix list to store the data in graph.
